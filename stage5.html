                <h3>What is a Notice of Appearance?</h3>
                <div>
                   The notice of appearance is filed in a circumstance where you have no way to contest against the foreclosure, however you still want to be served with all of the legal papers during the foreclosure case. You must file the notice of appearance and also sent a copy to your lender’s attorney.
                </div>

            </div>

            <div class="stage_container c2">
                
                <h3>What is an Answer?</h3>
                <div>
                   The answer is a document you can file which responds to each of the statements made by your lender. Here you can give a reason to why or why you are not responsible for the losses claimed by the lender. An answer gives the court and other parties notice to why you are defending against the foreclosure.
                </div>

            </div>

            <div class="stage_container c3">
                
                <h3>When should I send a Notice of Appearance?</h3>
                <div>
                   If you are not able to work out a deal with the lender during the settlement conference, then the lender will file the paperwork to the court asking for permission to foreclose on your home. Once this is done you can file a Notice of Appearance to see the paperwork filed.

            <div class="stage_container c4">
                
                <h3>When should I file an Answer?</h3>
                <div>
                   On the first page of the summons from the lender’s attorney, you should see that it says you need to file an answer to the complaint within <b>35 days</b> after you receive the summons. After you send the answer to the court, keep a copy in a safe place as proof that you did send it. Also make sure to mail a copy to your lender’s attorney.
