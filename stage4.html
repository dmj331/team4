                <h3>What is the Summons and Complaints documents?</h3>
                <div>
                   First one has to understand that New York is a judicial foreclosure state. This means that the lender has the right to sue if they are not getting mortgage payments. By bringing a lawsuit against you, the lender is able to obtain permission from the court to the sell the property. Money obtained from the property is then used to repay whatever is left on the debt. 
                </div>

            <div class="stage_container c2">
                
                <h3>When will I receive a summons?</h3>
                <div>
                   Since New York is a Judicial Foreclosure State, you will first receive the 30 daysâ€™ notice that the lender is trying to foreclose on you. You have 20 to 30 days to respond to this notice. The key thing to realize here is that being in a judicial foreclosure state allows you to automatically have the right to contest the foreclosure. This will give you several months time before the judge rules on whether to grant the foreclosure or not.

                <h3>What Should I Do?</h3>
                <div>
                   - Make sure that no matter what you contest the request for foreclosure. This will give you enough time to come up with a way to make your payments or get the foreclosure request dismissed by the judge.<br>
- The lender has to get a through a lot of paperwork to prove their case against you. For this reason, after you file response against the request, make sure to attend all hearings and voice your objections.
