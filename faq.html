                from an expert is the best thing you can do. Although you can do it on your own, doesn’t mean you

                <h3> 2. Do I have to file bankruptcy and will I lose my home?</h3>
                <div> No, bankruptcy is not necessary and is only one part of your credit. It is still possible to maintain a good standing
                by keeping up with all other lines of credit. There are many options available to help borrowers in trouble save their homes.

                <h3>3. How long till I can buy a house again?</h3>
                <div> Banks and Lenders now typically like to see 5-7 years since the foreclosure was discharged. However, some government 
                loan agencies currently require only 3 years.  Depending upon the down payment, there may also be 
                programs available that require only 1-2 years after the foreclosure has been settled.

                <h3>4. How are mortgage liens treated in New York?</h3>
                <div> New York is known as a lien theory state where the property acts as security for the underlying loan. The document that places the lien on the property is called a mortgage. It should be noted that New York does have a non-judicial foreclosure process however this is rarely used by lenders.

            <div id="faqFive" class="stage_container c5">
                
                <h3>5. How are New York mortgages foreclosed?</h3>
                <div> In New York, the lenders go to court in what is known as a judicial foreclosure proceeding where the court must issue a final judgment of foreclosure. The property is then sold as part of a publicly noticed sale. The court with jurisdiction over a foreclosure is known as the Supreme Court in the county in which the property is located. A foreclosure complaint involving a property in Manhattan would be filed in the Supreme Court of New York: New York County. A complaint is filed in this court along with what is known a lis pendens. A lis pendens is a recorded document that provides public notice that the property is being foreclosed upon.

            <div id="faqSix" class="stage_container c6">
                
                <h3>6. What are the legal instruments that establish an New York mortgage?</h3>
                <div> The documents are known as the mortgage, note, and in a commercial transaction, a security agreement. Sometimes the mortgage document is combined with the security agreement.  A mortgage is filed to evidence the underlying debt and terms of repayment, which is set forth in the note.

            <div id="faqSeven" class="stage_container c7">
                
                <h3>7. How long does it take to foreclose a property in New York?</h3>
                <div> It takes at least 6 to 8 months for a fore‐closure lawsuit to go from summons and complaint to auction — even if you ignore the court case. In reality, however, the process is taking much longer. If you file an Answer and appear at the mandatory settlement conference, it is taking lenders 1 to 3 years to foreclose. DON’T PANIC at the beginning of a foreclosure case. There is time to make a good decision. You continue to own the property all the way up until the auction — so up until the day the property is sold, you can sell, file bankruptcy, refinance, etc. If someone is still living in the home after the auction, the buyer may have to file an eviction to remove that person from the home.

            <div id="faqEight" class="stage_container c8">
                
                <h3>8. Is there a right of redemption in New York?</h3>
                <div> New York has no statutory right of redemption, which would allow a party whose property has been foreclosed to reclaim that property by making payment in full of the sum of the unpaid loan plus costs.
                </div>

            <div id="faqNine" class="stage_container c9">
                
                <h3>9. Are deficiency judgments permitted in New York?</h3>
                <div> Yes. A deficiency judgment may be obtained when a property in foreclosure is sold at a public sale for less than the loan amount which the underlying mortgage secures. This means that the borrower still owes the lender for the difference between what the property sold for at auction and the amount of the original loan. The Plaintiff must file a motion within 90 days after the property sale auction to enforce this right.

                <h3>10. What statuses govern New York foreclosures?</h3>
                <div> The laws that govern New York foreclosures are found in New York State Consolidated Laws, Article 13.
